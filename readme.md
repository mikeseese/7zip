# Mirror/fork of 7zip

This is a fork of 7zip for posterity's sake. 7zip's source code is on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/).

I've added a VSCode build task which just calls [build.bat](./CPP/7zip/build.bat), which you likely need to modify based off your Visual Studio install.

See the [license](./DOC/License.txt) and other contents in DOC for more details on 7zip.
